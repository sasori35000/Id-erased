<p class="news">The official release date for Attack on Titan season 4 has just been confirmed for Japan’s NHK, but Crunchyroll remains vague.<br>

When it comes to anime, there are very few shows that even come close to the level of popularity and notoriety as Attack on Titan.<br>

Following the insane finale to season 3, fans have been patiently waiting for news on when the fourth and final instalment of the hit anime would premiere.<br>
<p class="alc"><img class="alc" src="snk2.html" height="20%" width="20%"></p>
<p class="news">
Here is everything we know so far about when season 4 of Attack on Titan will release and what we can expect from the final chapter.<br>

Attack on Titan season 4 will premiere on December 7th on NHK in Japan and “later this year” on Crunchyroll.<br>
Many of us were expecting Attack on Titan season 4 to premiere in October, but on August 6th, the Animate Times removed the final season from their Fall Season schedule – indicating that an early 2021 premiere was now most likely.<br>

It has now been revealed that the fourth and final season of Attack on Titan will premiere on December 7th in Japan and “later this year” on Crunchyroll.<br>

In the build up to season 4, an Attack on Titan original movie that will recap seasons 1-3 called ‘Chronicle’ will premiere on November 18th.<br>

There have also been unconfirmed reports that it will be a two-cour split season of 10 and 12 episodes – similar to how season 3 was released.<br>
 So, it may be the case that we get the first part airing between December 2020 and January 2021, with the final part coming later in 2021.<br></p>

ATTACK ON TITAN SEASON 4: PLOT<br>
Spoiler warning: We will NOT be revealing any specific spoilers for season 4 from the manga, but do not read on unless you wish to know more.<br>

Season 4 will follow the story in chapter 91 of the manga series and initially focus on what happened to Eren and his team in the immediate aftermath of season 3<br>

This change of environment has been confirmed in the reveal trailer, which shows a completely new landscape that resembles a World War-esc battlefield.<br>

We also see several new titans and whilst we don’t expect these to play the main role in season 4, they may indeed influence the final battle with Marley. <br>
Although there are also rumblings that a brand-new titan ability will play a massive part in season 4.<br></p>
